<h1>Geolocation: Prisoner of War (easy)</h1>

<h2>Starting info</h2>
<p>Location is in the AOR shown in the map. The girl would have been walking west to Kayes on RN1. The password is the exact name of the listing on Google Maps, meaning it has to be an indexed location.</p>

<h2>Write-up</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Zoomed into the AOR on Google Maps. First focused on where the 'x' was marked in the prompt, on RN1 south of Banaya and between Kabat√© and Tafasriga. Started following the road and clicking on various location pins looking for any promising names or images similar to the one in the prompt.</li>
  <li>Had no luck and fell down a rabbit hole for a while (detailed below).</li>
  <li>Searched for "childrens' homes Mali" in Google Maps, which led me to Village D'Enfants Sos Khouloum Kayes.</li>
  <li>The building looked similar to the building pictured in the prompt. The gazebo and row of triangles stood out in particular. Hacktoria prisoner of war prisoner-of-war-village-d-enfants *That was it! Answer: village-d-enfants-sos-khouloum-kayes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rabbit hole</h2>
<ul>
  <li>After not having any luck searching through all the locations I could find along RN1, I thought maybe the 'x' was a red herring and expanded my search to include anywhere in the AOR.</li>
  <li>I scanned through Google Maps and still followed RN1, but searched further north and south from the road. I also went down side roads to search through various towns.</li>
  <li>I did this for way too long and finally gave up and started desperately plugging (mostly useless) queries into Google. I continued doing that for a while before I finally thought to search "childrens' homes Mali" in Google Maps.</li>
</ul>
